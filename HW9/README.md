# Week 9: Filter a BAM file
**Ruben Martin**

For this assigment i uses the references genome for the european buff-tailed bumblebee (*Bombus terrestris*) (GCF_910591885.1) and the SRR from the WGS of this species (SRR3693403) used in the assigment #8

1. How many reads did not align with the reference genome?

```bash
samtools view -c -f 4 ${BAM}
```
```
107185
```
107,185 reads didt alling to the references genome 

2. How many primary, secondary, and supplementary alignments are in the BAM file?
* primary aligments 
```bash
samtools view -c -F 256 ${BAM}
```
```bash
38156820
```

* secondary aligments 
``` bash 
samtools view -c -f 256 ${BAM}
```
```
0
```

* Suplementary aligments 

``` bash
samtools view -c -f 2048 ${BAM}
```
```
190798
```
using the `flags` `256` and `2048` we can filtrate for the primary, secondary and complementary aligments 


3. How many properly paired alignments on the reverse strand are formed by reads contained in the first pair (read1) file?
```bash
samtools view -c -f 99 ${BAM}
```
```
8681628
```
There are 868,1628 properly paired alignments on the reverse strand in the read 1 file

4. Make a new BAM file that contains only the properly paired primary alignments with a mapping quality of over 10.

```bash
samtools view -h -b -q 10 -f 1 -F 256 ${BAM} > ${Q10}
samtools index bam/b_terrestris_q10.bam
```


5. Compare the flagstats for your original and your filtered BAM file.

There was a loss of about 25% in the filtered data, but most of the retained reads were primary reads, and low-quality reads were removed.
The percentage of properly paired reads increased from 91.09% to 96.90% in the filtered BAM, suggesting better alignment quality.
